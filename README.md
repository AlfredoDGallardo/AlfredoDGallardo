# 👋 Hi, I'm Alfredo Gallardo

I'm a data-driven Business Process Analyst with a passion for turning raw data into actionable insights. I specialize in reporting, automation, and process optimization using tools like Excel, Power BI, and Salesforce.

This GitHub profile serves as my portfolio, showcasing real-world reporting projects I've created in roles related to education, operations, and compliance. Whether it’s tracking student mileage to clinical sites or analyzing enrollment trends by state, I use data to support better decision-making and operational efficiency.
